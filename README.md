**Stay Normal**
If you only take one thing away from reading this blog post, let it be this:
Normal mode is your best friend!

Avoid staying in insert mode for extended periods of time. And also, donâ€™t move
along the file while in insert mode. It might be difficult in the beginning, but
once you get used to it, you will see how much faster you become. ;)
